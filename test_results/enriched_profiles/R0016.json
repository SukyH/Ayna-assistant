I bring with me experience of working with commercial, military, charter, and prototype aircraft. I am experienced and\nknowledgeable with Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Dornier, and Lockheed and have proven myself to be both versatile when working with various\naircraft makes & customers.\nExperience\nJanuary 2011\nto\nCurrent\nCompany Name\n \nCity\n \n, \nState\n \nPurchaser / Production Coordinator\nMy journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and\ncustomer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.\nIn this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.\nI worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these\nparts as necessary.\nWhen services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate\npaperwork to purchasing.\nDaily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.\nBeing a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more\nclosely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.\nLike coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.\nIn addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed\naccurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.\nBeing on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where\nbuyers spend more time on parts themselves.\nPurchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.\nI have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.\nIf it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.\nBuyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.\nWe then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.\nOutside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.\nIn addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an\nindustry standard to rise above the competition.\nPurchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.\nThese savings of course benefits everyone on the company.\nPurchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is\nkey in this position.\nFebruary 2009\nto\nDecember 2010\nCompany Name\n \nCity\n \n, \nState\n \nPurchasing Clerk / Material Specialist\nWorking with Vision Airlines included a lot of different \nresponsibilities.\nNot only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse,\nShipping, and Receiving responsibilities.\nBeing a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.\nAfter receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.\nIf needed, get approval to proceed with the order.\nCoordinate ",
