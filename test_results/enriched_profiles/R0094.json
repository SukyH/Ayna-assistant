lives\nup to high personal standards integrity/ethics; pro-actively demonstrates good interface/communication, task management.\nHighlights\n3D Model part design and assembly development\nincluding BOM generation.\nCreate weight distribution analysis as well as present\nfindings and able to defend assumptions.\nHeavy and light structural frame design and aluminum mounting platform design.\nStrong under\n standing of hydraulic components and able to do troubleshooting with the\nability to develop and improve hydraulic circuits from existing schematics.\nExperience\nCompany Name\n \nMay 2013\n \nto \nJuly 2015\n \nMechanical Designer\n \nCity\n \n, \nState\nAs a member of the Research and Technology team, I was able to be a part of several projects focused on saving the company money by\nreducing down time of equipment, use of tested and approved quality parts and material.\nDesigns were developed with the use of Creo Parametric 2.0, Windchill and Autodesk Inventor 2015.\nDesigned, tested and implemented a pneumatic circuit to insure proper conditions existed prior to engaging and dis-engaging the clutch on\nthe Frac pump units.\nThis circuit protects the clutch from premature failure and unnecessary ware.\nInvestigated Fluid End failures and corrected drawing errors related to seat angel.\nThis significantly increased the life of the Fluid Ends.\nCreated approved source control drawings for the fluid end valves and seats witch eliminated the use of misaligned seat and premature\nwashouts of the fluid ends.\nDesigned a cross unit manifold used to connect up to twenty two (22) Frac Pumps to run off natural gas or field gas.\nThis significantly reduced fuel cost across the fleet of Frac pumps.\nTroubleshot and redesigned the hydraulic circuit on the fleets sand conveyers.\nThis redesign significantly reduced down time and reduced the amount of training needed for field hands.\nTroubleshot and redesigned the hydraulic circuit on a potential venders sand conveyor to correct an issue they were not able to correct.\nThis redesign involved changing the spool in the PVG valve and installing a cross port relief valve and some re-plumbing of the hydraulic\ncircuit.\nTroubleshot and corrected the spillage of sand from the sand conveyors.\nThis reduced the amount of down time related to sand cleanup and removal.\nDesigned a dust control system for the company's fleet of sand kings.\nCompany Name\n \nApril 2011\n \nto \nMay 2013\n \nMechanical Designer\n \nCity\n \n, \nState\nAs a member of the Coil Tubing Unit (CTU) team, I help to ensure our design and manufactured products meet the rigorous industry\nstandards established by the American Petroleum Institute and the International Standards Organization by the use of 3D parametric model\ngeneration and manipulation using Autodesk Inventor Pro 2012 (Routed Systems - Tube and Pipe) and Autodesk Vault Professional 2102.\nCreate weight distribution analysis as well as present findings and able to defend assumptions.\nCTU trailer layout redesigned to eliminate costly manufacturing rework, errors and confusion.\nHydraulic Wet Kit assembly and frame design.\nHeavy and light structural frame design and aluminum mounting platform design.\nCapable of setting up 3D models for use with the integrated Autodesk stress analysis FEA with the understanding of setting the\nconvergence, material, constraints and loads with the ability to interpret hot spots and make adjustments to the model.\nHave knowledge of, and can apply, the use of section modulus tables to determine how one shape compares to another in strength for a\ndirectional load Able to research possible problems with material selection or component interface and present options.\nVendor/Purchasing Q &A sit-in's for second sourcing prospects.\nDirect and indirect interaction with customer regarding additional customer supplied hardware installations.\nTake initiative to procure data (research) and make contacts in order to bring viable solutions to the forefront.\nCompany Name\n \nJanuary 2009\n \nto \nFebruary 2010\n \nPlanning Engineer\n \nCity\n \n, \nState\nApplied Aerodynamics Inc. is a FAA/EASA Repair Station and is focused on, but not limited to, Repair / Overhaul / Manufacturing of flight\ncontrol surfaces and aircraft composites.\nI was responsible for the planning of incoming repair orders for aviation parts and for repair station planning and work instruction for aircraft\ncomponents from minor skin repairs to complete rib, skin and spar replacement.\nAs Planning Engineer I also created and developed internal procedures and assured compliance to the D1-51991 Digital Product Definition\n(DPD) for Boeing Suppliers.\nThe successful on-sight Boeing DPD audit allowed Applied Aerodynamics to begin downlo",
